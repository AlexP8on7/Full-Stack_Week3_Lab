STRATEGY DESCRIPTION:
We are using Adj Closes that are 30% below the 100MA to create buy signals, and sell signals are created when 100MA crossovers occur, more than 40 days have elapsed, or we reach the end of the year.

PROMPT USED:
Create a trading strategy optimizer that tests multiple moving average periods (50, 100, 200), buy thresholds (70%-90% below MA), and maximum holding periods (30-60 days). Optimize on 2024 data and backtest from 2014-2025. Use compound returns for performance measurement.
